             What is fast fashion? Fast fashion is the distribution of cheap clothing  that allows us to wear trendy clothing.  But what most aren’t aware of are the negative impacts fast fashion has on our world.

      While fast fashion makes clothing more affordable, it has a disastrous impact on the environment.The textile industry is the second largest polluter in the world. Water contamination is a type of pollution that is a result fast fashion. Polyester has minute microfibers which, when washed, can avoid the sewage and enter our waterways. Water is an important resource in order for cotton to grow. According to Sustain You Style, up to 20,000 liters of water are needed to produce just 1kg of cotton. This consumes a lot of this already scarce resource. The fashion industry also contributes to the great amount of greenhouse gases( taking up 10% of humanity’s carbon emissions) because of the energy used until the point of selling the garments. The majority of manufacturing occurs in China and India, countries that essentially rely on coal(which is very harmful in terms of carbon emissions).

      When we hear the term fast fashion, usually the inhumane conditions that the workers are in, doesn’t come to mind. Many know fast fashion as a concern to our environmental health and the carcinogens that are involved in making the clothing. But another big part of this problem, is the inadequate protection of the workers because many nations don’t have appropriate labor laws. In the fast fashion industry, the workers are predominantly women because of the lack of opportunities in their country. By making them work long hours and  paying them very less, this is how fast fashion companies are able to sell clothing for cheaper prices. They are mostly supervised by men and most women are too scared to protest for better wages and conditions.
